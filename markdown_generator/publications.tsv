2021-07-25	An Interpretable Catboost Model to Predict the Power of Combined Cycle Power Plants 	IEEE Xplore	In this study, a Catboost model which can predict the electrical energy output (EP) of a combined cycle power plant is presented. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value achieved with the Catboost model is 0.0678, that is outstandingly lower in comparison with other methods in existing literature. Finally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were employed to explain the inner workings of the Catboost model	@incollection{Joy2021Jul,  author = {Joy, Rafat Ashraf},  title = {{An Interpretable Catboost Model to Predict the Power of Combined Cycle Power Plants}},  booktitle = {{2021 International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)}},  journal = {2021 International Conference on Information Technology (ICIT)},  pages = {435--439},  year = {2021},  month = {Jul},  publisher = {IEEE},  doi = {10.1109/ICIT52682.2021.9491700} }	paper-title-number-1	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9491700
2021-08-27	Fine Tuning the Prediction of the Compressive Strength of Concrete : A Bayesian Optimization Based Approach	IEEE Xplore	This study demonstrates the efficacy of Bayesian Optimization to improve the performance of machine learning models for predicting the strength properties of concrete specimens. In the first phase of the study, five machine learning models(SVR, ABR, RFR, GBR and KNN Regressor) were compared on the basis of rmse, mae and r-squared value on the test set. Two best performing models(GBR and RFR) were selected among the five models for further improvement. In the second phase, hyperparameter tuning by Bayesian Optimization method was done on these two models. Experimental results testify that Bayesian Optimization on these two models improved their prediction performance further. 	@incollection{Joy2021Aug,  author = {Joy, Rafat Ashraf},  title = {{Fine Tuning the Prediction of the Compressive Strength of Concrete : A Bayesian Optimization Based Approach}},  booktitle = {{2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)}},  journal = {2021 International Conference on INnovations in Intelligent SysTems and Applications (INISTA)},  pages = {1--6},  year = {2021},  month = {Aug},  publisher = {IEEE},  doi = {10.1109/INISTA52262.2021.9548593} }	paper-title-number-2	https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9548593
