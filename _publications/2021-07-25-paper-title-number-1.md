title: "An Interpretable Catboost Model to Predict the Power of Combined Cycle Power Plants "
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-07-25-paper-title-number-1
excerpt: 'In this study, a Catboost model which can predict the electrical energy output (EP) of a combined cycle power plant is presented. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) value achieved with the Catboost model is 0.0678, that is outstandingly lower in comparison with other methods in existing literature. Finally, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) were employed to explain the inner workings of the Catboost model'
