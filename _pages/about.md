# About Me

* I'm currently pursuing Bachelors in Computer Science at [Shahjalal University of Science and Technology](https://www.sust.edu/). 


* My [[CV](https://rajoy99.github.io/files/joyCV.pdf)] here 


My areas of interest are:
<ul>
<li>Explainable Machine learning </li>
<li>Generative Models </li>
<li>Computer Vision </li>
<li>Time Series Analysis </li>
</ul>
Quite recently, I have been working on my undergraduate thesis on score based generative models for oversampling tabular data.
